A GUI game created for a Software Engineering course. 
The game was built to run a team of heroes who explores 
several maps, buy items, powerups, battle villains with mini-games, 
and ultimatly defeat the main supervillain to finish the game with
random events involved.

The whole project was written in Java and using Java Swings to create 
the graphical interface.
